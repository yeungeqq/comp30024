    This is the entry point for your submission. You should modify this
    function to solve the search problem discussed in the Part A specification.
    See `core.py` for information on the types being used here.

    Parameters:
        `board`: a dictionary representing the initial board state, mapping
            coordinates to "player colours". The keys are `Coord` instances,
            and the values are `PlayerColor` instances.  
        `target`: the target BLUE coordinate to remove from the board.
    
    Returns:
        A list of "place actions" as PlaceAction instances, or `None` if no
        solution is possible.

    # codes, set the `ansi` flag to True to print a colour-coded version!
